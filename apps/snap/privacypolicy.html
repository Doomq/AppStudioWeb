    <h3>Snap to PDF — Privacy Policy</h3>

    <div class="section">
      <h4>Overview</h4>
      <p>
        Snap to PDF is a simple image‑to‑PDF and document scanning app. We designed it to respect your privacy:
        we do not create user accounts, and we do not collect personal information for analytics or advertising.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <h4>Information Collection and Use</h4>
      <p>
        The app does <strong>not</strong> collect personal information such as your name, email, address, or device identifiers (including IDFA). 
        Your scans, photos, and generated PDFs are processed <strong>on-device</strong> using Apple frameworks (e.g., VisionKit, PDFKit) and remain on your device unless you choose to export or share them.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <h4>Permissions We Request</h4>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Camera</strong> — to capture documents using the device camera.</li>
        <li><strong>Photos</strong> — to import images from your photo library and to optionally save exported PDFs to Photos.</li>
        <li><strong>Files / iCloud Drive</strong> — to save or export PDFs to the Files app or iCloud Drive when you choose to do so.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Permissions are used solely for the stated functionality. You can change these permissions in your device Settings at any time.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <h4>User Content</h4>
      <p>
        “User Content” includes photos, scans, PDFs, and file names you create in the app. This content is stored locally on your device. 
        You control export and deletion. Temporary processing files may be created during export and are removed by the app or the system.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <h4>Third‑Party Services</h4>
      <p>
        We use <strong>RevenueCat</strong> to manage in‑app purchases (subscriptions and lifetime unlock). RevenueCat processes 
        anonymized purchase receipts and subscription status to validate your entitlement. It does not use your data for advertising or behavioral profiling.
      </p>
      <p>
        When you share or export a file via the iOS Share Sheet to another service (e.g., Mail, Drive, Dropbox), that action is initiated by you, and
        the destination service’s privacy policy applies.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <h4>Advertising</h4>
      <p>
        The app does not display third‑party ads and does not share data for advertising or tracking purposes.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <h4>Data Sharing</h4>
      <p>
        We do not sell, rent, or share personal data with third parties. Purchase metadata required for entitlement validation may be shared with RevenueCat.
        No analytics SDKs or advertising networks are integrated.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <h4>Data Retention</h4>
      <p>
        RevenueCat retains non‑personal purchase records for as long as necessary to provide your subscription entitlements and comply with legal obligations.
        Your locally stored User Content remains on your device until you delete it or uninstall the app.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <h4>Security</h4>
      <p>
        We rely on iOS sandboxing and system protections to help safeguard your locally stored content. While no system can be 100% secure,
        we do not transmit your documents to our servers, reducing exposure risk.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <h4>Children’s Privacy</h4>
      <p>
        Snap to PDF is not directed to children. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13.
        If you believe a child has provided us information, please contact us so we can promptly delete it.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <h4>Changes to This Policy</h4>
      <p>
        We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Material changes will be reflected by updating the “Last updated” date above.
        Continued use of the app after changes become effective constitutes acceptance of the updated policy.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <h4>Contact</h4>

    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>

    <h3>AI Headshot Pro — Privacy Policy</h3>

    <div class="section">
      <h4>Overview</h4>
      <p>
        AI Headshot Pro is an AI-powered application that generates professional portrait photos based on user-uploaded images.
        We take privacy seriously. The app does not require user accounts, and photos are processed only for the purpose of generating headshots.
        Photos are not used for advertising, tracking, or profiling.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <h4>Information Collection and Use</h4>
      <p>
        The app <strong>does not collect</strong> personal information such as name, email address, home address, or advertising identifiers (IDFA).
        Users may upload a photo (selfie / portrait) that may contain facial data.
        These photos are used solely to generate a professional headshot according to the selected style.
      </p>
      <p>
        The app <strong>does not perform facial recognition</strong>, does not extract faceprints, biometric templates, embeddings, or any other biometric identifiers.
        Photos are not used for identity verification, profiling, advertising, or analytics purposes.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <h4>Permissions We Request</h4>
      <p>
        The app may request access to the camera and photo library in order to upload images that you choose to use for headshot generation.
        No additional system permissions are typically required.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <h4>User Content</h4>
      <p>
        “User Content” includes uploaded photos (which may contain a face) and generated headshots.
        These files are stored locally on your device.
        Photos are not stored on our own servers.
        You may delete this content at any time by deleting the app or removing specific files from your device.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <h4>Third-Party Services</h4>
      <p>
        To generate headshots, user-uploaded photos may be temporarily sent to our AI service provider (such as OpenAI) strictly for the purpose of processing the request and returning the generated image.
        These providers act as data processors and only process data necessary to deliver the requested functionality.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>RevenueCat</strong> may be used to manage subscriptions and verify in-app purchases.
        RevenueCat processes only technical subscription-related metadata.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <h4>Advertising</h4>
      <p>
        AI Headshot Pro does not display third-party advertisements and does not share any data for advertising or user tracking purposes.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <h4>Data Sharing</h4>
      <p>
        We do not sell or rent personal data.
        User-uploaded photos are shared only with AI service providers for the purpose of generating the requested headshot.
        This data is not shared for marketing purposes and is not provided to data brokers.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <h4>Data Retention</h4>
      <p>
        Photos and generated headshots are stored locally on the user's device and remain there until the user deletes them.
      </p>
      <p>
        Our AI service provider may temporarily retain API inputs and outputs for security and abuse-prevention purposes (for example, up to 30 days), in accordance with their privacy policy.
        The app itself does not retain copies of photos on its own servers.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <h4>Security</h4>
      <p>
        We rely on iOS system-level security mechanisms (sandboxing, permission controls, and encrypted HTTPS communication).
        Photo transmission to the AI service provider is performed over secure connections.
        Because the app does not operate its own backend for storing photos, long-term storage risks are minimized.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <h4>Children’s Privacy</h4>
      <p>
        The app is not intended for children under the age of 13 and we do not knowingly collect personal information from children.
        If you believe a child has provided personal data, please contact us and we will take appropriate action.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <h4>Changes to This Policy</h4>
      <p>
        We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Changes will be reflected by updating the “Last updated” date above.
        Continued use of the app after changes constitutes acceptance of the updated policy.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
